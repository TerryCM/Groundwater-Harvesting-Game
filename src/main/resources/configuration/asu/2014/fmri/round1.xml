<h1>Round {self.roundNumber} Instructions</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    This is the first round of the experiment. The length of the round is
    {duration}. As in the practice round you can collect green tokens but now
    you will earn <b>{dollarsPerToken}</b> for each token collected.  You
    <b>cannot</b> reset the distribution of green tokens. 
</p>
<h3>Groups</h3>
<hr>
<p>
In this round the renewable resource will become two times bigger.  You will share
this larger environment with four other random players in this room.  Each
participant in the room has been randomly assigned to one of several equal-sized
{self.clientsPerGroup} person groups and everyone in your group has been randomly
assigned a number from 1 to {self.clientsPerGroup}.  You will stay in the same group for
the entire experiment, and each person's number from 1 to {self.clientsPerGroup} will
remain the same throughout the experiment. The other members of your group will
appear on the screen as blue dots <img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/gem-other.gif">
with a white number embedded in the dot.
</p>
<p>
    In each round of the token task, you can see how many tokens each player has
    collected at the top right corner of the screen.  On the top left corner of the
    screen you will see the remaining time in the round.
</p>
<h3>Anonymity</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    Because group membership was randomly assigned by the computer, neither you nor
    the experimenter will be able to identify which person in the room has been
    assigned to a particular group or number within a group.  Your anonymity is
    guaranteed.
</p>
<h3>Tokens</h3>
<hr>
    <p>
        Each group has its own set of token resources.
    </p>
<p><b>Do you have any questions so far?</b>  If you have any questions at this time, raise your hand and someone will come over to your station and answer it.</p>
