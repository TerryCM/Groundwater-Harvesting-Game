<h1>Round {self.roundNumber} Instructions</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    This is the first round of the experiment. The length of the round is {duration}. As in the practice round you can
    collect green tokens. However, this time you will earn <b>{dollarsPerToken}</b> for each token collected.  You
    <b>cannot</b> reset the distribution of green tokens. 
</p>
<p>
    On the top right corner of the screen you can see how many tokens you have collected. On the top left corner of the
    screen you can see the amount of time remaining in the round.
</p>
<p><b>Do you have any questions so far?</b>  If you have any questions at this time, raise your hand and someone will
    come over to your station and answer it.</p>
