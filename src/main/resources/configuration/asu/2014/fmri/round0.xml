<h2>Practice Round Instructions</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Once everyone has finished the quiz, we will start a practice round of the token
    task.
</p>
<p>
During the practice round, you will have {duration} to practice with the
experimental environment. The decisions you make in this round will NOT influence
your earnings.  At the beginning of the practice round {initialDistribution} of the
cells are occupied with green tokens.  The environment is a {self.resourceWidth} x
{self.resourceDepth} grid of cells.
</p>
<p>
During this practice round, and <b>only during</b> this practice round, you are able
to reset the tokens displayed on the screen by pressing the <b>R</b> key.  When you
press the <b>R</b> key you will reset the distribution of the tokens to randomly occupying 
{initialDistribution} of the cells with tokens.
</p>
<p><b>Do you have any questions?</b> If you have any questions at this time please raise your hand and someone will come over to your station and answer it.</p>

            {if (allCorrect)}
            You have answered all the questions correctly and earned <b>{totalQuizEarnings}</b>.  
            {else}
            You answered {numberCorrect} out of {totalQuestions} questions correctly and earned <b>{totalQuizEarnings}</b>.  Questions you've answered
            incorrectly are highlighted in red.  Please see below for more details.
            {endif}
        </p>
        <br><hr>
<form>
<span class='q1'>Q1. Tokens grow from the middle of the screen.</span> <br>
    <b>{incorrect_q1}
        This statement is false. Tokens only regenerate when there are other tokens present in their immediately
        neighboring cells. They do not spontaneously generate from the middle of the screen.
    </b>
<br><br>
<span class='q2'>Q2. In order to collect a token you need to press the space bar while your yellow dot is on a cell with a token.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q2} 
        This statement is true. You must press the space bar when your yellow dot is on a cell with a token to collect that token.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q3'>Q3. When you have collected all tokens on the screen, no new tokens will appear.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q3} 
        This statement is true. Tokens can only regenerate if there are other tokens present in their immediately neighboring cells.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q4'>Q4. Your decisions of where to collect tokens affects the regeneration of tokens.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q4} 
        This statement is true. The chance that a new token will appear in an empty cell is greatest when the eight cells surrounding that
        empty cell all have tokens. 
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q5'>Q5. Is the following sequence possible?</span>
<img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/q5.png" /> 
<br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q5} 
        Yes, this sequence is possible. New tokens can regenerate on an empty cell when neighboring cells have existing tokens.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q6'>Q6. Is the following sequence possible?</span><img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/q6.png" /> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q6} 
        No, this sequence is not possible. New tokens cannot regenerate on an empty cell when all neighboring cells are also empty.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q7'>Q7. If each token is worth $0.02 and you collect 100 tokens in a round, you have earned 3 dollars in that round.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q7} 
        This statement is false. You would have earned 100 * $0.02 = $2.00 in that round.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q8'>Q8. The duration of the practice round is four minutes.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q8} 
        This statement is true. The practice round will last four minutes.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q9'>Q9. All the cells are filled with green tokens at the start of the experiment.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q9} 
        This statement is false. At the beginning of each round, 25% of the cells will be filled with green tokens.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q10'>Q10. The amount of tokens you can earn only depends on how fast you collect the tokens.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q10} 
        This statement is false. The amount of tokens you can earn depends on how you manage your tokens, not how fast you collect them.
