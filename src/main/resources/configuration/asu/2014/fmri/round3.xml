<h1>Round {self.roundNumber} Instructions</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    This is round {self.roundNumber} of the experiment. The length of the round is again {duration} minutes. As in the
    previous rounds you can collect green tokens.
</p>
<h3>Groups</h3>
<hr>
<p>
In this round the renewable resource will become twice as big. You will share this larger environment with one other
player in this room that has been randomly selected. Each group of two's resource environment is distinct from the other
groups.
</p>
<p>
You will stay in the same group for the entire experiment. The other player will appear on
the screen as a blue dot <img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/gem-other.gif">.
</p>
<p>
    In each round you can see how many tokens each player has collected at the top right corner of the screen.  On the
    top left corner of the screen you will see the remaining time in the round.
</p>
<h3>Anonymity</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    Because group membership was randomly assigned by the computer, neither you nor the experimenter will be able to
    identify which person in the room has been assigned to a particular group. Your anonymity is
    guaranteed.
</p>
<p><b>Do you have any questions so far?</b>  If you have any questions at this time, raise your hand and someone will come over to your station and answer it.</p>
