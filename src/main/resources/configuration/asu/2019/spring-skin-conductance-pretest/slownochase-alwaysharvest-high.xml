<h1>AGGRESSIVE NOCHASE: Instructions for Stage {self.roundIndexLabel}</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    Stage {self.roundIndexLabel} consists of {self.repeat} rounds. The
    length of each of the following {self.repeat} rounds in this 
    stage is {self.duration} seconds. As in the practice round you
    can collect green tokens. However, this time you will earn
    <b>{dollarsPerToken}</b>  for each token collected. You
    <b>cannot</b> reset the distribution of green tokens.   
</p>
<p>
    Also, there will be <b> another player collecting tokens </b> in the
    same grid as you.  
</p>
<p>
    On the top right corner of the screen you can see how many tokens
    you have collected. On the top left corner of the 
    screen you can see the amount of time remaining in the round.
