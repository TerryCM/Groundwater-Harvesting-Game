<p>
In this round the renewable resource will become twice as big. You will share this larger environment with one other
player in this room. The other player will appear on the screen as an orange circle
<img width='23' height='23' src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/orange-circle.png">.
</p>
<p>
    In each round you can see how many tokens each player has collected at the top right corner of the screen.  On the
    top left corner of the screen you will see the remaining time in the round.
</p>
<p><b>Do you have any questions so far?</b>  If you have any questions at this time, raise your hand and someone will come over to your station and answer it.</p>
