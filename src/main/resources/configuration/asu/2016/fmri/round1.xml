<h1>Round {self.roundNumber} Instructions</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    This is the first round of the experiment. The length of the round is {duration}. As in the practice round you can
    collect green tokens. However, this time you will earn <b>{dollarsPerToken}</b> for each token collected.  You
    <b>cannot</b> reset the distribution of green tokens. 
</p>
<p>
    On the top right corner of the screen you can see how many tokens you have collected. On the top left corner of the
    screen you can see the amount of time remaining in the round.
</p>
<p><b>Do you have any questions so far?</b>  If you have any questions at this time, raise your hand and someone will
    come over to your station and answer it.</p>

    <h2>Quiz Results</h2>
    <hr>
        <p>
            {if (allCorrect)}
            You have answered all the questions correctly and earned <b>{totalQuizEarnings}</b>.  
            {else}
            You answered {numberCorrect} out of {totalQuestions} questions correctly and earned <b>{totalQuizEarnings}</b>.  Questions you've answered
            incorrectly are highlighted in red.  Please see below for more details.
            {endif}
        </p>
        <br><hr>
<form>
<span class='q1'>Q1. Tokens grow from the middle of the screen.</span> <br>
    <b>{incorrect_q1}
        This statement is false. Tokens only regenerate when there are other tokens present in their immediately
        neighboring cells. They do not spontaneously generate from the middle of the screen.
    </b>
<br><br>
<span class='q2'>Q2. In order to collect a token you need to press the space bar while your yellow dot is on a cell with a token.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q2} 
        This statement is true. You must press the space bar when your yellow dot is on a cell with a token to collect that token.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q3'>Q3. When you have collected all tokens on the screen, no new tokens will appear.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q3} 
        This statement is true. Tokens can only regenerate if there are other tokens present in their immediately neighboring cells.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q4'>Q4. Your decisions of where to collect tokens affects the regeneration of tokens.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q4} 
        This statement is true. The chance that a new token will appear in an empty cell is greatest when the eight cells surrounding that
        empty cell all have tokens. 
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q5'>Q5. Is the following sequence possible?</span>
<img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/q5.png" /> 
<br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q5} 
        Yes, this sequence is possible. New tokens can regenerate on an empty cell when neighboring cells have existing tokens.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q6'>Q6. Is the following sequence possible?</span><img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/q6.png" /> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q6} 
        No, this sequence is not possible. New tokens cannot regenerate on an empty cell when all neighboring cells are also empty.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q7'>Q7. If each token is worth $0.02 and you collect 100 tokens in a round, you have earned 3 dollars in that round.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q7} 
        This statement is false. You would have earned 100 * $0.02 = $2.00 in that round.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q8'>Q8. The duration of a round is four minutes.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q8} 
        This statement is true. The round will last four minutes.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q9'>Q9. All the cells are filled with green tokens at the start of the experiment.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q9} 
        This statement is false. At the beginning of each round, 25% of the cells will be filled with green tokens.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q10'>Q10. The amount of tokens you can earn only depends on how fast you collect the tokens.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q10} 
        This statement is false. The amount of tokens you can earn depends on how you manage your tokens, not how fast you collect them.
