<h2>Practice Round Instructions</h2>
<hr>
<p>
You will now have {self.duration} seconds to practice with the experimental environment. The decisions you make in this
round will <b>not affect your earnings</b>. At the beginning of the practice round {initialDistribution} of the cells
are occupied with green tokens.  The environment is a {self.resourceWidth} x {self.resourceDepth} grid of cells.
</p>
<h2>Tokens Regenerate</h2>
<table width="100%">

<h2>Best Strategy</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    The chance that a token will regenerate on an empty cell increases as there are
    more tokens surrounding it.  The best arrangement of tokens that maximizes overall regrowth is the checkerboard
    diagram shown below.

<p>
During this practice round, and <b>only during this practice round</b>, you will be able
to reset the tokens displayed on the screen by pressing the <b>R</b> key.  When you
press the <b>R</b> key you will reset the distribution of the tokens to once again randomly occupy
{initialDistribution} of the cells with tokens.
