<h2>Practice Round Instructions</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    During the practice round, you will have {self.duration} seconds to practice with the experimental environment. The
    decisions you make in this round will NOT influence your earnings.  At the beginning of the practice round
    {initialDistribution} of the cells are occupied with green tokens.  The environment is a {self.resourceWidth} x
    {self.resourceDepth} grid
    of cells.
</p>
<h2>Best Strategy</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    The chance that a token will regenerate on an empty cell increases as there are
    more tokens surrounding it.  The best arrangement of tokens that maximizes overall regrowth is the checkerboard
    diagram shown below.

<p>
    During this practice round, and <b>only during</b> this practice round, you are able to reset the tokens displayed
    on the screen.  When you push the <b>R</b> key you will reset the distribution of the tokens to randomly occupying
    {initialDistribution} of the cells with green tokens.
</p>
<p><b>Do you have any questions?</b> If you have any questions at this time please raise your hand and someone will come over to your station and answer it.</p>
