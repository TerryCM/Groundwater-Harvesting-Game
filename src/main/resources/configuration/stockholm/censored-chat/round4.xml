<h3>Round {self.roundNumber} Instructions</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    Round {self.roundNumber} is the same as the previous two rounds with two exceptions.  
    <ol>
        <li>
            Before the next round starts you can anonymously communicate via text
            messages for four minutes with the other participants in your group. You
            can use this opportunity to discuss the experiment and coordinate your
            actions to improve your earnings. You may not promise side-payments
            after the experiment is completed or make any threats. You are also not
            allowed to reveal your real identity. We are monitoring the chat traffic
            while you chat.
        </li>
        <li>
            During the next round you will have the option to reduce the earnings of another
            participant at a cost to your own earnings.
            <ul>
                <li>If you press the numeric key 1-{clientsPerGroup} corresponding
                    to another participant, you will reduce the number of tokens
                    they have collected in this round by
                    <b>{self.sanctionPenalty}</b> token(s). This will also
                    reduce your own token amount by <b>{self.sanctionCost}</b>
                    token. The decision whether or when to use this option is up to
                    you. 
                </li>
                <li>When you reduce the number of tokens of another participant,
                    they will receive a message stating that you have reduced their
                    tokens. Likewise, if another participant reduces your number of
                    tokens, you will also receive a message. These messages will be
                    displayed on the bottom of your screen. 
                </li>
                <li>If your tokens are being reduced or you are reducing another
                    participant's tokens, you will receive some visual cues.  When
                    your tokens are being reduced your yellow dot will turn red
                    briefly with a blue background.  The participant reducing your
                    tokens will turn purple with a white background. 
                </li>
                <li>You may only reduce other participants' tokens as long as there
                    are tokens remaining on the screen and while both you and the
                    other participant have a positive number of tokens collected
                    during the round.  <b>Each time</b> you press the numeric key
                    corresponding to another participant your token amount is
                    reduced by <b>{self.sanctionCost}</b>, and their token amount is reduced by
                    <b>{self.sanctionPenalty}</b>.  <b>Note:</b> You can only remove
                    tokens from a participant that is visible to you. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    The length of this round is {duration}.
</p>
<p><b>Do you have any questions?</b> If you have any questions at this time please raise your hand and someone will come over to your station and answer it.</p>
