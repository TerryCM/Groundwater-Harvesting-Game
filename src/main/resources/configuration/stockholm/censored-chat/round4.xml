<h3>Round 4 Instructions</h3>
<hr>
<p>
Round 4 is the same as the previous two rounds with two exceptions.  
</p>
<p>
Before the next round starts you can anonymously communicate by text messages
for four minutes with the other participants in your group. You can use this
opportunity to discuss the experiment and coordinate your actions to improve
your earnings. You may not promise side-payments after the experiment is
completed or make any threats. You are also not allowed to reveal your real
identity. We are monitoring the chat traffic while you chat.
</p>
<p>
During the next round you will have the option to reduce the earnings of another
participant at a cost to your own earnings.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you press the numeric key 1-5 corresponding to another participant, you
will reduce the number of tokens they have collected in this round by two
tokens. This will also reduce your own token amount by one token. The decision
whether or when to use this option is up to you. 
<li>When you reduce the number of tokens of another participant, they will
receive a message stating that you have reduced their tokens. Likewise, if
another participant reduces your number of tokens, you will also receive a
message. These messages will be displayed on the bottom of your screen.
<li>If your tokens are being reduced or you are reducing another participant's
tokens, you will receive some visual cues.  When you are sanctioned your yellow dot will turn red briefly with a blue background.  The participant sanctioning you will turn purple with a white background.
<li>You may sanction other participants as long as there are
tokens remaining on the screen and while both you and the other participant
have a positive number of tokens collected during the round.  <b>Each time</b>
you press the numeric key corresponding to another participant your token
amount is reduced by <b>one</b>, and their token amount is reduced by
<b>two</b>.  <b>Note:</b> You can only remove tokens from a participant that is
visible to you.
</ul>
<p>

<p>
The length of this round is four minutes.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions please raise your hand.  <b>Do you have any
questions so far?</b>
