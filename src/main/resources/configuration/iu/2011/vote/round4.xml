<h1>Important New Instructions</h1>
<h2>Strategies for managing how players collect tokens for the rest of the experiment</h2>
<hr>
<p>
In a moment, you will have the option to implement one of six strategies for how you
and the three other people in your group collect tokens for the rest of the
experiment.
</p>
<h2>Procedure for Deciding the Strategy</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Each of the {clientsPerGroup} people in your group can nominate one of the six
    potential strategies.  The single strategy that receives the most nominations
    wins.
</p>
<p>
    <b>If there is a tie</b>, one of the tied options will be selected at random by
    the computer.  Each of the tied strategies will have an equal chance of being
    selected.
</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<hr>
    <p>Neither the computer nor the experimenter will intervene to implement the
        strategy.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Do you have any questions?</b>  If you have any questions at this time,
        raise your hand and someone will come over to your station and answer it.

results on the next screen. The results will be presented to each person in
your group.
</p>
<h2>Your selection will be anonymous</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The identity of people who nominated a particular strategy will NOT be revealed.
Therefore, neither you nor the experimenter will know who nominated a particular
strategy.
