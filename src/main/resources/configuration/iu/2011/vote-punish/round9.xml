    <p>
        This was the last round, but not the end of the experiment. We will now
        determine your payments. While we are doing this, we request that you
        carefully fill out a brief survey.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we are ready we will call you one by one to the room next door. We
        will
        pay you there in private. Please wait until your computer number is called,
        and then proceed to the room next door to turn in your computer number and
        your survey. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Please answer the survey carefully and thank you for participating. 
    </p>
