<h3>Round 4 Instructions</h3>
<hr>
<p>
Round 4 is the same as the previous two rounds with one exception.  
</p>
<p>
Before the next round starts you can anonymously communicate by text messages
for four minutes with the other participants in your group. You can use this
opportunity to discuss the experiment and coordinate your actions to improve
your earnings. You may not promise them side-payments after the experiment is
completed or make any threats. You are also not allowed to reveal your real
identity. We are monitoring the chat traffic while you chat.
</p>
<p>
The length of this round is four minutes.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions please raise your hand.  <b>Do you have any
questions so far?</b>

<p>
You can now chat with the other participants in your group for 4 minutes
total. During the chat round, you may communicate about any aspect of the
experiment that you would like to discuss with other participants with whom
you have been matched. You may not promise them side-payments after the
experiment is completed or threaten them with any consequence after the
experiment is finished. We are monitoring the chat traffic while you chat. If
we see that somebody reveals his or her identity, we have to stop the
experiment and remove the whole group from which this person is a member out
of this room.
</p>
<p>
You will see other participants labeled as "1", "2","3", "4", or "5" in the
chat box.  You can send a chat message by typing into the textfield at the
bottom of the screen and clicking the "send" button with your mouse or
pressing the "enter" key on your keyboard.
