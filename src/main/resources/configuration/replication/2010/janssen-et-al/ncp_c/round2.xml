        <h3>Instructions for the Next {self.repeat} Rounds</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The next {self.repeat} rounds are the same as the previous rounds with one exception - you will now be able
            to communicate with the other participants in your group. Before the next round starts you can anonymously
            communicate via text messages for {self.chatDuration} seconds with the other participants in your group. You
            can use this opportunity to discuss the experiment and coordinate your actions to improve your earnings. You
            may not promise them side-payments after the experiment is completed or make any threats. You are also not
            allowed to reveal your real identity. We will be monitoring the chat traffic while you chat.
        </p>
        <p>
            The length of this round is again {duration}.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have any questions please raise your hand.  <b>Do you have any questions so far?</b>
