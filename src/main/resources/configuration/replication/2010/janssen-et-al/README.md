To test the effect of costly punishment versus communication, we performed a series of experiments using six different
treatments. Each treatment consisted of three consecutive 4-min periods of costly punishment (P), communication (C), or
a combination of both (CP) and three consecutive 4-min periods when neither communication norpunishment (NCP) is
allowed. All treatments thus consisted of six decision periods, each lasting 4 min. Half the treatments started with NCP
and the others finished with NCP. Each treatment was run five or six times. In total, 165 persons participated in 33
groups. 

This directory contains the treatment configuration files for the following treatments:

* NCP-P (3 rounds of no communication or costly punishment, then 3 rounds of costly punishment)
* NCP-CP (3 rounds NCP, 3 rounds of communication + costly punishment)
* NCP-C (3 rounds NCP, 3 rounds of communication)
* P-NCP (3 rounds punishment, 3 rounds NCP)
* CP-NCP (3 rounds communication + costly punishment, 3 rounds NCP)
* C-NCP (3 rounds communication, 3 rounds NCP)
