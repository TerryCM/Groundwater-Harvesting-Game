<h3>Practice Round Instructions</h3>
<hr>
<p>
You will now have four minutes to practice with the experimental environment. The
decisions you make in this round will NOT influence your earnings.  At the beginning
of the practice round half of the cells are occupied with green tokens.  The
environment is a 13 x 13 grid of cells.
</p>
<p>
During this practice round, and <b>only during</b> this practice round, you are able
to reset the tokens displayed on the screen by pressing the <b>R</b> key.  When you
press the <b>R</b> key you will reset the resource to its initial distribution,
randomly filling half of the cells.
</p>
<p><b>Please do not communicate with any other participant.</b></p>
<p>If you have any questions please raise your hand. <b>Do you have any
questions so far?</b></p>
