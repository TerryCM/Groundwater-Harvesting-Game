<p>
You can chat with the other participants in your group during this round.
You may communicate about any aspect of the experiment that you would like to
discuss with other participants with whom you have been matched. You may not promise
them side-payments after the experiment is completed or threaten them with any
consequence after the experiment is finished. We are monitoring the chat traffic
while you chat. If we see that somebody reveals his or her identity, we have to stop
the experiment and remove the whole group from which this person is a member out of
this room.
</p>
<p>
You will see other participants labeled as "1", "2","3", "4", or "5" in the chat
box.  You can send a chat message by typing into the textfield and pressing the
enter key.
