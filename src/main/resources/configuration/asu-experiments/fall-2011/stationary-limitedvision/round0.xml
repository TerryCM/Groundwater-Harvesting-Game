<h3>Task</h3>
<p>
You will be matched with another person in your group, but you will not know who
that person is.  And that person will not know who you are.  You make decisions for
the case you are drawn to be player 1 and the case you will be player 2.  The
results of the decisions are given to you at the end of the whole experiment.
</p>

<p>
The person drawn to be player 1 has the following decision to make. You will receive
an endowment of one dollar and decide how much to keep and how much to send to
another person in your group. 
</p>

<p>
The amount you send to the other person will be tripled and then given to the person
in your group with whom you have been matched.  That person will decide how much to
keep and how much to send back to you.  For example, if you send 0 extra credit
points to the other person, 0 extra credit points will be sent to the other person.
However, if you write 3 extra credit points on the form, 9 extra credit points will
be sent to the person.  The other person would then decide how much to return to
you.
</p>

<p>
Player 2 has the following decision to make. You have to chose for each of the 4
possible cases how much to receive from player 1 how much to keep and how much to
send back to player 1.
We ask you to fill in the tables for player 1 as well as for player 2, and we will
drawn whether you are player 1 or 2 after you have made the decisions.
</p>

<p>
Are there any questions?  If you have a question, raise your hand and I will try to
answer it.
