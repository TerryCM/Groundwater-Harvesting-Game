You may now propose a regulation that you wish to have in place during the
round.  After all participants in your group have submitted a regulation you
will be able to vote for a regulation by ranking from from 1 to 5, where 1 is
the most favorable and 5 is the least favorable.
</p>
<ul>
<li>You have 60 seconds to propose a regulation.</li>
<li>Enter your regulation in the text area below.  It will be submitted
automatically once the time ends.</li>

You can now chat with the other participants in your group for 4 minutes
total. During the chat round, you may communicate about any aspect of the
experiment that you would like to discuss with other participants with whom
you have been matched. You may not promise them side-payments after the
experiment is completed or threaten them with any consequence after the
experiment is finished. We are monitoring the chat traffic while you chat. If
we see that somebody reveals his or her identity, we have to stop the
experiment and remove the whole group from which this person is a member out
of this room.
</p>
<p>
You will see other participants labeled as "1", "2","3", "4", or "5" in the
chat box.  You can send a chat message by typing into the textfield at the
bottom of the screen and clicking the "send" button with your mouse or
pressing the "enter" key on your keyboard.

<form>
Each time I press the numeric keys between 1-5 my tokens will be reduced
by:<br>
<input type="radio" name="q1" value="0">0 tokens<br>
<input type="radio" name="q1" value="1">1 token<br>
<input type="radio" name="q1" value="2">2 tokens<br>
<input type="radio" name="q1" value="4">4 tokens<br>

Each time I press the numeric keys between 1-5 the number of tokens of the
corresponding participant is reduced by:<br>
