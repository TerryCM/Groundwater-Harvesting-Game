<h3>Round 1 Instructions</h3>
<hr>
<p>
This is the first round of the experiment. The length of the round is 4
minutes. Like in the practice round you can collect green tokens. This time
you earn <b>two cents</b> for each token collected. This time you
<b>cannot</b> reset the distribution of green tokens. 
</p>
<p>
In this round the renewable resource will become five times bigger.  You will share this
larger environment with four other players in this room that have been randomly
selected.  One group's resource environment is distinct from the other groups.
</p>
<p>
Each of you has been assigned a number from 1 to 5.  These numbers will remain the
same throughout the experiment but you will <b>not</b> be able to identify which
person in the room has been assigned which number, so your anonymity is guaranteed.  

The other four players will appear on the screen as blue dots 
<img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/gem-other.gif"> with a white
number embedded in the dot.  On the top right corner of the screen you can see 
how many tokens each player has collected. On the top left corner of the screen you can see 
a clock that displays the remaining time in the round.</p>
<p>
If you have any questions please raise your hand.  <b>Do you have any
questions so far?</b>
