<h3>Round 4 Instructions</h3>
<hr>
<p>
The length of the round is 4 minutes. As in the practice round you can collect
green tokens. This time you earn <b>two cents</b> for each token collected.
This time you <b>cannot</b> reset the distribution of green tokens. 
</p>
<p>
In this round the renewable resource will become four times bigger. You will
share this larger environment with four other players in this room.  Each of
you has been randomly assigned to one of several equal-sized groups.  Each of
the groups is collecting tokens from an identical, but separate resource. 
</p>
<p>
Each of you has been assigned a number from 1 to 4.  The other three players
will appear on the screen as blue dots 
<img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/gem-other.gif"> with a white
number embedded in the dot.  On the top right corner of the screen you can see
how many tokens each player has collected.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions please raise your hand.  <b>Do you have any
questions so far?</b>
