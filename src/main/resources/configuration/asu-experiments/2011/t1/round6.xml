<h2>Survey</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This was the last round, but not the end of the experiment. We will now
determine your payments. While we are doing this, we request that you
carefully fill out a brief survey.
</p>
<h2>Payments</h2>
<hr>
    <p>NOTE: Your computer number is <b>{id}</b></p>
<p>
When we are ready we will call you one by one to the room next door. We will
pay you there in private. Please wait until your computer number, <b>{id}</b>, is
called, and then proceed to the room next door to turn in your computer number and
your survey. 
</p>
<p>
Please answer the survey carefully and thank you for participating.
