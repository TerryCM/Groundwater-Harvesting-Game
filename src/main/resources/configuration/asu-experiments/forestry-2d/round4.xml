<h3>Round 5 Instructions</h3>
<hr>
<p>
This round is the same as the previous round.  However, before the next round
starts you will be given the opportunity to anonymously communicate by text
messages for four minutes with the other participants in your group. You can
use this opportunity to discuss the experiment and coordinate your actions to
improve your earnings. You may not promise them side-payments after the
experiment is completed or make any threats. You are also not allowed to
reveal your real identity. We are monitoring the chat traffic while you chat.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions please raise your hand.  <b>Do you have any
questions so far?</b>

<p>
You can now chat with the other participants in your group for 4 minutes
total. During the chat round, you may communicate about any aspect of the
experiment that you would like to discuss with other participants with whom
you have been matched. You may not promise them side-payments after the
experiment is completed or threaten them with any consequence after the
experiment is finished. We are monitoring the chat traffic while you chat. If
we see that somebody reveals his or her identity, we have to stop the
experiment and remove the whole group from which this person is a member out
of this room.
</p>
<p>
You will see other participants labeled as "1", "2","3", or "4" in the chat
box.  You can send a chat message by typing into the textfield at the bottom
of the screen and then clicking the "send" button with your mouse or pressing
the "enter" key on your keyboard.  </p>

You may send private messages to a specific participant by clicking on the
appropriately labeled button (1, 2, 3, or 4) before typing your message in the
chat box and sending it.  By default you are communicating with all members of
your group.

<![CDATA[
<p>
This was the last round, but not the end of the experiment. We will now
determine your payments. While we are doing this, we request that you
carefully fill out a brief survey.
</p>
<p>
When we are ready we will call you one by one to the room next door. We will
pay you there in private. Please wait until your computer number is called,
and then proceed to the room next door to turn in your computer number and
your survey. 
</p>
<p>
Please answer the survey carefully and thank you for participating.
