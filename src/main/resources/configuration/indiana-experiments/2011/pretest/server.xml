<p>
    This facilitator interface allows you to control the experiment.  In general you
    will be following a sequence similar to this:
    <ol>
        <li>Show instructions</li>
        <li>Start round</li>
        <li>After round is over
            <ol>
                <li>show trust game if necessary</li>
                <li>start standalone chat round if necessary</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Goto 1.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Welcome</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Welcome to the experiment. The experiment will begin shortly after everyone has been
assigned a station.
<br><br>
Please <b>wait quietly</b> and <b>do not close this window, open any other applications, or communicate with any of the other participants</b>.

<h1>General Instructions</h1>
<p>
    <b>Welcome</b>. You have already earned 5 dollars just for showing up at this experiment. 
</p>
<p>
You can earn more, up to a maximum of about 40 dollars, by participating in this
experiment which will take about an hour to an hour and a half. The amount of money
you earn depends on your decisions as well as the decisions of other people in this room
over the course of the experiment.
</p>
<h2>How to participate</h2>
<hr>
<p>
You will appear on the screen as a yellow dot <img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/gem-self.gif"></img>. 
You can move by pressing the four arrow keys on your keyboard.  
</p>
<p>
    You can move up, down, left, or right.  You have to press a key for each and
    every move of your yellow dot.  As you move around you can collect green diamond
    shaped tokens <img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/gem-token.gif"></img> and earn two
    cents for each collected token.  To collect a token, move your yellow dot over a
    green token and <b>press the space bar</b>.  Simply moving your avatar over a
    token does NOT collect that token.
</p>

<h2>Tokens</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The tokens that you collect have the potential to regenerate.  After you have
collected a green token, a new token can re-appear on that empty cell. The rate at
which new tokens appear is dependent on the number of adjacent cells with tokens.
The more tokens in the eight cells that surround an empty cell, the faster a new
token will appear on that empty cell.  In other words, <b>existing tokens can
generate new tokens</b>.  To illustrate this, please refer to Image 1 and Image 2.
The middle cell in Image 1 denoted with an X has a greater chance of regeneration
than the middle cell in Image 2.  When all neighboring cells are empty, there is
<b>no chance for regeneration</b>.
</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>Image 1</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>Image 2</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    <img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/8neighbors.jpg" alt="image 1"></img>
</td>
<td align="center">
    <img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/5neighbors.jpg" alt="image 2"></img>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Best Strategy</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The chance that a token will regenerate on an empty cell increases as there are
more tokens surrounding it.  Therefore, you want to have as many tokens around an
empty cell as possible.  However, you also need empty cells to benefit from this
regrowth.  The best arrangement of tokens that maximizes overall regrowth is the
checkerboard diagram shown below.

<h1>Instructions</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    You will now participate in an exercise where you will be matched with a random
    person in your group. In this exercise there are two roles, Player 1 and Player 2.
    Your job is to design strategies for both Player 1 and Player 2 roles.  When you
    are randomly paired with another member of your group you may be selected as
    Player 1 <b>or</b> Player 2.  The results of randomly pairing your strategies
    with the other group member's strategies will be shown to you at the <b>end of
    the experiment</b>.
</p>

<h2>How to participate</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
    <li>Player 1 will first receive an endowment of one dollar and has to decide <b>how much to keep</b>.  The remaining amount is <b>sent to Player 2</b>.
    <li>The amount Player 1 sends to Player 2 is tripled by the system and then
        given to Player 2.  Player 2 must then decide <b>how much to keep</b> and <b>how much to send back to Player 1</b>.
</ol>
<p>
For example, if Player 1 sends 0 cents to Player 2, Player 1 earns 1 dollar and
Player 2 earns 0 cents. However, if Player 1 sends 1 dollar to Player 2, 3 dollars
would be sent to Player 2.  Player 2 then decides to return $1.75 back to Player 1.
In this case, Player 1 earns $1.75, and Player 2 earns $1.25.
</p>
<p>
Please fill in the following form to design your strategies as Player 1 or Player 2.
<br>
<b>If you have any questions, please raise your hand.  Are there any questions?</b>

<entry key="chat-instructions">
<![CDATA[
<p>
You can chat with the other participants in your group during this round.
You may discuss any aspect of the experiment with the other participants in your group with two exceptions:
<ol>
    <li>You <b>may not promise side-payments after the experiment is completed or threaten anyone with any consequence after the experiment is finished</b>.</li>
    <li>You <b>may not reveal your actual identity</b></li>
</ol>
We are monitoring the chat traffic while you chat. If we detect any violation of the
rules we will have to stop the the experiment and remove the group where the offense
occurred from the room.
</p>
<p>
You will see other participants labeled as "1", "2","3", "4", or "5" in the chat
box.  You can send a chat message by typing into the textfield and pressing the
enter key.
