In a moment, you will see a screen on your computer called Rule Options. It
will list 6 different rules that you can consider as options for managing how
each of your groups collect green tokens today. 
</p>
<p>
You can nominate one rule from the list to help decide whether or not to have a
rule and what that rule will be. The rule that has the most nominations will be
considered chosen and established as the rule. If there is a tie, then each

    <h1>Important New Instructions! Reducing other player's earnings.</h1>
    <hr>
<p>
Beginning with the upcoming round you will have the option to reduce the earnings of
another participant at a cost to your own earnings.
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each player in your group has a number from 1 to {clientsPerGroup}.  If
            you press a number key 1-{clientsPerGroup}, you will reduce the number
            of tokens that player has collected during the round by
            {sanctionPenalty} tokens. This will also reduce your own token amount by
            {sanctionCost} token. The decision whether or when to use this option is
            up to you. 
        </li>
        <li>When you reduce the number of tokens of another participant, they will
            receive a message stating that you have reduced their tokens. Likewise, if
            another participant reduces your number of tokens, you will also receive a
            message. These messages will be displayed on the bottom of your screen.
        </li>
        <li>If your tokens are being reduced or you are reducing another participant's
            tokens, you will receive some visual cues.  When your tokens are being reduced
            your yellow dot will turn red briefly with a blue background.  The participant
            currently reducing your tokens will turn purple with a white background.
        </li>
        <li>You may reduce the earnings of other participants as long as (1) there are
            tokens remaining on the screen and (2) both you and the other participant
            have a positive number of tokens collected during the round.  <b>Each time</b>
            you press the numeric key corresponding to another participant your token
            amount is reduced by <b>{sanctionCost}</b>, and their token amount is reduced by
            <b>{sanctionPenalty}</b>.  
        </li>
    </ul>
