<p>
    This facilitator interface allows you to control the experiment.  In general you
    will be following a sequence similar to this:
    <ol>
        <li>Show instructions</li>
        <li>Start round</li>
        <li>After round is over
            <ol>
                <li>show trust game if necessary</li>
                <li>start standalone chat round if necessary</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Goto 1.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Welcome</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Welcome to the experiment. The experiment will begin shortly after everyone has been
assigned a station.
<br><br>
Please <b>wait quietly</b> and <b>do not close this window, open any other
    applications, or communicate with any of the other participants</b> unless you
are told to do so.

<h1>General Instructions</h1>
<h2>Your Earnings</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    You have already earned {showUpPayment} by showing up at this experiment.  You can
earn more, up to a maximum of about $15-$40, by participating in this experiment
which will take about an hour to an hour and a half. The amount of money you earn
depends on your decisions as well as the decisions of your group members.</p>
<h2>The Token Task</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Today's experiment is on the computer.  In the experiment, you can collect green
    diamond shaped tokens <img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/gem-token.gif"></img>, and
    you will earn <b>{dollarsPerToken}</b> for each token you collect.  When the token task
    begins, you will appear on the screen as a yellow dot <img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/gem-self.gif"></img>.  
    To collect a token, move your yellow dot over a green token and <b>press the
    space bar</b>.  If you move over a token without pressing the space bar you will
    NOT collect that token. You can move either up, down, left, or right.  You have
    to press an arrow key for every move of your yellow dot.
</p>
<p>
    Later, you will be assigned to a group.  The other group members will appear as
    blue dots <img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/gem-other.gif"></img>.

<h2>Tokens</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The tokens that you collect have the potential to regenerate.  After you have
collected a green token, a new token can re-appear on that empty cell. The rate at
which new tokens appear is dependent on the number of adjacent cells that still have
tokens. The more tokens there are in the eight cells around  empty cell, the faster
a new token will appear on that empty cell.  
</p>
<p>
Tokens generate new tokens.  Thus, the middle cell, which is denoted with X in Image 1 will be regenerated at a faster rate than the middle cell in Image 2.  
When all neighboring cells are empty, there is no renewal.
</p>

<p>
    If you have any questions at this time, please raise your hand and someone will
    come over to your station and answer it.  If you have no questions, continue to
    the quiz below.

<h1>Instructions</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    You will now participate in an exercise where you will be matched with a random
    person in your group. In this exercise there are two roles, Player 1 and Player 2.
    Your job is to design strategies for both Player 1 and Player 2 roles.  When you
    are randomly paired with another member of your group you may be selected as
    Player 1 <b>or</b> Player 2.  The results of randomly pairing your strategies
    with the other group member's strategies will be shown to you at the <b>end of
    the experiment</b>.
</p>

<h2>How to participate</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
    <li>Player 1 will first receive an endowment of one dollar and has to decide <b>how much to keep</b>.  The remaining amount is <b>sent to Player 2</b>.
    <li>The amount Player 1 sends to Player 2 is tripled by the system and then
        given to Player 2.  Player 2 must then decide <b>how much to keep</b> and <b>how much to send back to Player 1</b>.
</ol>
<p>
For example, if Player 1 sends 0 cents to Player 2, Player 1 earns 1 dollar and
Player 2 earns 0 cents. However, if Player 1 sends 1 dollar to Player 2, 3 dollars
would be sent to Player 2.  Player 2 then decides to return $1.75 back to Player 1.
In this case, Player 1 earns $1.75, and Player 2 earns $1.25.
</p>
<p>
Please fill in the following form to design your strategies as Player 1 or Player 2.
<br>
<b>If you have any questions, please raise your hand.  Are there any questions?</b>

<![CDATA[
<p>
You can chat with the other participants in your group during this round.
You may discuss any aspect of the experiment with the other participants in your group with two exceptions:
<ol>
    <li>You <b>may not promise side-payments after the experiment is completed or threaten anyone with any consequence after the experiment is finished</b>.</li>
    <li>You <b>may not reveal your actual identity</b></li>
</ol>
We are monitoring the chat traffic while you chat. If we detect any violation of the
rules we will have to stop the the experiment and remove the group where the offense
occurred from the room.
</p>
<p>
You will see other participants labeled as "1", "2","3", "4", or "5" in the chat
box.  You can send a chat message by typing into the textfield and pressing the
enter key.
