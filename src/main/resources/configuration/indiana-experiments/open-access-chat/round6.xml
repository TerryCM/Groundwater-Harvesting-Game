<p>
This was the last round, but not the end of the experiment. We will now
determine your payments. While we are doing this, we request that you
carefully fill out a brief survey.
</p>
<p>
When we are ready we will call you one by one to the room next door. We will
pay you there in private. Please wait until your computer number is called,
and then proceed to the room next door to turn in your computer number and
your survey. 
</p>
<p>
Please answer the survey carefully and thank you for participating.

You can now chat with the other participants in your group for 4 minutes
total. During the chat round, you may communicate about any aspect of the
experiment that you would like to discuss with other participants with whom
you have been matched. You may not promise them side-payments after the
experiment is completed or threaten them with any consequence after the
experiment is finished. We are monitoring the chat traffic while you chat. If
we detect that somebody has revealed their identity, we will have to stop the
experiment and remove that person's entire group from the experiment.
</p>
<p>
You will see other participants labeled as "1", "2","3", "4", or "5" in the
chat box.  You can send a chat message by typing into the textfield at the
bottom of the screen and clicking the "send" button with your mouse or
pressing the "enter" key on your keyboard.  </p>
