<p>
You can now chat with the other participants in your group for 4 minutes
total. During the chat round, you may communicate about any aspect of the
experiment that you would like to discuss with other participants with whom
you have been matched. You may not promise them side-payments after the
experiment is completed or threaten them with any consequence after the
experiment is finished. We are monitoring the chat traffic while you chat. If
we detect that somebody has revealed their identity, we will have to stop the
experiment and remove that person's entire group from the experiment.
</p>
<p>
You will see other participants labeled as "1", "2","3", "4", or "5" in the
chat box.  You can send a chat message by typing into the textfield at the
bottom of the screen and clicking the "send" button with your mouse or
pressing the "enter" key on your keyboard.  </p>

<h3>Round 1 Instructions</h3>
<hr>
<p>
This is the first round of the experiment. The length of the round is 4
minutes. As in the practice round you can collect green tokens but there are
two important differences. You will earn <b>two cents</b> for each token
collected and you <b>cannot reset</b> the distribution of green tokens. 
</p>
<p>
In this round the renewable resource will become five times bigger. You
will share this larger environment with four other players in this room.
Each of you has been randomly assigned to one of several equal-sized
groups.  Each of the groups is collecting tokens from an identical, but
separate resource. 
</p>
<p>
Each of you has been assigned a number from 1 to 5.  The other four players
will appear on the screen as blue dots 
<img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/gem-other.gif"> with a white
number embedded in the dot.  On the top right corner of the screen you can see
how many tokens each player has collected.
</p>
<p>
Before the next round starts you can anonymously communicate via text messages
for four minutes with the other participants in your group. You can use this
opportunity to discuss the experiment and coordinate your actions to improve
your earnings. You may not promise them side-payments after the experiment is
completed or make any threats. You are also not allowed to reveal your real
identity. We will be monitoring the chat traffic while you chat.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions please raise your hand.  <b>Do you have any
questions so far?</b>
