<h3>Round 4 Instructions</h3>
<hr>
<p>
In this round you will no longer have the ability to communicate or reduce the
tokens of other participants.  
</p>
<p>
Each of you has been assigned a number from 1 to 5.  The other four players
will appear on the screen as blue dots 
<img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/gem-other.gif"> with a white
number embedded in the dot.  On the top right corner of the screen you can see
how many tokens each player has collected.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions please raise your hand.  <b>Do you have any
questions so far?</b>
